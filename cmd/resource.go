Show all subjects with access to a given resource

This command slices the authorization space (subject, resource, verb)
along a plane of fixed resource.

Rakkess retrieves all (Cluster)Roles plus their bindings and evaluates the
authorization for the given resource and verbs. The result is shown as a
matrix with verbs in the horizontal and subjects in the vertical direction.

Note that the effective access right may differ from the shown results due to
group membership such as 'system:unauthenticated'.
